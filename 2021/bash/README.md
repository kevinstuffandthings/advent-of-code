# [Simulmedia](https://simulmedia.com) Bash Club

We'll try to do the first exercise for each day, for as long as we can, until `bash` just can't handle it anymore.
For many of these, `bash` would be the wrong choice. So this is all academic. We'll just try to showcase techniques that would
be useful in our daily lives, even if they aren't the perfect choice. Hopefully we all learn a lot just by trying.
